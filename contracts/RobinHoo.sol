@title RobinHoo Coin

Based on Inedible Coin
https://www.inediblecoin.com/
0x3486b751a36f731a1bebff779374bad635864919

The difference is that RobinHoo **allows** sandwich attack BUT it tries to punish the bot
and forcibly take a fee from it's balance and give it to the victim.
In case it can't, the 2nd sandwich transaction will be reverted.
